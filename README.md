**Lifestyle-First Neighborhood Matching for Indian Young Professionals**

A  web application that helps Indian users aged 20-35 find their perfect neighborhood based on lifestyle preferences using advanced cosine similarity algorithms and real-time data integration.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Young professionals aged 20-35 in India struggle to find neighborhoods that truly match their lifestyle‚Äîsuch as safety, walkability, healthcare access, and fast internet preferences beyond traditional filters like price and commute distance, leading to compromised living decisions and reduced quality of life in India's rapidly urbanizing cities.

## üî¨ Research Foundation

### Primary Research Question
Can a lifestyle-first neighborhood matching algorithm using cosine similarity improve housing decisions for young Indian professionals compared to existing property-centric platforms?

### Validated Hypotheses (Based on 21 Authentic Survey Responses)

1. **Safety Priority Hypothesis** ‚úÖ Confirmed
   - Young Indian professionals prioritize safety (3.76/5 average) as the most critical neighborhood factor
   - Safety ranked highest among all 12 lifestyle factors

2. **Technology Infrastructure Hypothesis** ‚úÖ Confirmed  
   - Fast internet connectivity (3.67/5 average) is equally critical as healthcare access
   - Essential for India's tech-savvy young professional demographic

3. **Balanced Work-Life Atmosphere Preference** ‚úÖ Confirmed
   - 38.1% prefer "Mix of Quiet yet Lively" neighborhoods over purely quiet or bustling environments
   - Supports balanced lifestyle approach

4. **Information Gap** ‚úÖ Confirmed
   - 66.7% chose "Local amenity finder" and 61.9% chose "Cost of living comparison" as top desired features
   - Demonstrates strong demand for lifestyle intelligence beyond basic property filters

## üöÄ How It Works

### Advanced Matching Algorithm

The app uses **weighted cosine similarity** with real-time data enrichment:

1. **User Preference Collection** - Interactive sliders for 8 lifestyle factors (1-5 scale)
2. **Real-time Data Enrichment** - Live API integration with OpenStreetMap, Overpass, Open-Meteo
3. **Smart Processing** - Optimized to process top 20 neighborhoods for performance
4. **Weighted Comparison** - Survey-based importance weights applied
5. **Similarity Calculation** - Cosine similarity with explainable scoring
6. **Result Presentation** - Top 7 matches with detailed breakdowns

### Lifestyle Factor Weights (Based on Survey Data)

| Factor | Weight | Survey Score | Rationale |
|--------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Safety | 22% | 3.76/5 | Highest priority across all demographics |
| Walkability | 18% | 3.67/5 | Urban mobility importance |
| Healthcare | 18% | 3.67/5 | Critical infrastructure access |
| Fast Internet | 16% | 3.67/5 | Digital necessity for remote work |
| Affordability | 12% | 3.48/5 | Market reality in expensive cities |
| Restaurants | 6% | 3.43/5 | Lifestyle enhancement |
| Public Transport | 4% | 3.24/5 | Commuting necessity |
| Parks & Greenery | 4% | 3.33/5 | Quality of life factor |
